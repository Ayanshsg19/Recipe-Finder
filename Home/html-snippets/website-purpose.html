				This website was created with the sole purpose to help people, who at the end of the day always have the question - "aaj khaane mei kya banau ?"
			</li>
			<li>
				This website takes the ingredients and raw food material you have at home but have no idea what to make from it.
			</li>
			<li>
				The website then output you the best dish, which would contain most of your input ingredient (if not all) with the recipe, to make your hunger and thought process ("of what to make or what not to make" - reprised version of the Hamlet &copy; ) reduced to a minimum.
			</li>
